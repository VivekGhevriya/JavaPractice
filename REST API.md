## What is API means?

Application Programming Interface
When third party wants to access the data from the another server we have to go through API.

Ex. Third Party Airline Reservation website 

expedia.ca

it's fetching the data from various Air through API where airline provides special API key to EXPEDIA.CA.
 
Another example can be considered as a waiter at the Cafe.
Where waiter helps us to bring the food.
